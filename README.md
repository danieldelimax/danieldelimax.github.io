# Tic-Tac-Toe

This project is a simple implementation of the classic two-player Tic-Tac-Toe game, built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It's an ideal project for anyone learning web development who wants to see how game logic can be created directly in the browser.

## 🚀 Features

- **Player Setup:** The page prompts users to enter their names upon loading, personalizing the game experience.
- **Intuitive Interface:** A clean and user-friendly board that clearly indicates whose turn it is.
- **Game Logic:** The JavaScript script manages turns, checks for win or draw conditions, and prevents invalid moves.
- **Notifications:** Clear messages are displayed to announce the winner or if the game ends in a tie.
- **Restart Game:** A button allows players to start a new match at any time.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **HTML5:** For the page structure.
- **CSS3:** For styling the board and interface elements.
- **JavaScript:** For the core game logic.
